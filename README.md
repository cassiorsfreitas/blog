# Blog
Project open source created with Next JS + Vercel to generate static pages (SSG) through getStaticPaths and getStaticProps feature. Posts are written in Markdown and managed by the application itself.

A blog by a full-stack developer, digital marketing analyst and consumer experience enthusiast. Team Liquid fan and musician in his spare time. Whenever possible, I like to teach my friends about something I've learned, I think that's why this blog was born.

In the last decade, front end development went through multiple paradigm changes that make it hard to follow. SSG? SPA? SSR? Which one?

I thought that could be important to talk about the main structures of a front end website. Above all, to explain the main consequences each interface imposes and that some people just catch at the end of the project.

So, let's see the differences and when to use!

## Application types

Even if you've never developed for front end before, you've probably heard of React JS, Vue JS, Angular, etc. These are some examples of frameworks and libraries that have grown a lot in the last 5 years and the reason is simple: they all improved the web development experience and delivered ready-made packaged "solutions". In addition making building web applications "easier", it also ensures more security, performance and scalability.

However, each of these libraries and frameworks suggest a front end architectural pattern. In this article, we are going to talk about Static Site Generation, Single Page Application and Server Side Rendering.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

We all know that we can create pure static HTML, CSS and Javascript files and serve them through a server, right? I mean, you write yourself file by file defining the entire structure of your project. Besides this way, it is also possible to generate these same files from other tools without having to write all files as before.

There are a lot of famous static generators like Gatsby, Hexo, Next and so on. In this case, the generators basically get the data through an API or markdown file, for example, do some processes and in the end generate the same HTML, CSS and JS files.
